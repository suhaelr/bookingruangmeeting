# Cloudflare Turnstile Integration

## Overview
This document describes the integration of Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA into the login page of the Laravel application.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Integration
- **Location**: `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php`
- **Script**: Added Cloudflare Turnstile API script in the head section
- **Widget**: Added Turnstile widget between password field and login button
- **Configuration**:
  - Site Key: `0x4AAAAAAB56ltjhELoBWYew`
  - Theme: Light
  - Size: Normal
  - Callbacks: `onTurnstileSuccess` and `onTurnstileError`

### Backend Integration
- **Location**: `app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php`
- **Method**: `verifyTurnstile()` - Private method for server-side verification
- **Secret Key**: `0x4AAAAAAB56ljRNTob9cGtXsqh8c-ZuxxE`
- **Validation**: Added `cf-turnstile-response` to login form validation

### Security Features
1. **Client-side validation**: Login button is disabled until Turnstile verification succeeds
2. **Server-side verification**: Token is verified with Cloudflare's API before processing login
3. **Error handling**: Proper error messages for failed verification
4. **Logging**: All verification attempts are logged for security monitoring

### User Experience
- Users must complete the Turnstile challenge before they can submit the login form
- The login button remains disabled until verification is successful
- Clear error messages are displayed if verification fails
- The widget is centered and styled to match the existing design

### Testing
To test the integration:
1. Start the Laravel development server: `php artisan serve`
2. Navigate to the login page
3. Try to submit the form without completing the Turnstile challenge (should be disabled)
4. Complete the Turnstile challenge and verify the login button becomes enabled
5. Submit the form and verify the server-side validation works

### Configuration
The Turnstile keys are currently hardcoded in the application. For production deployment, consider moving these to environment variables:

```env
TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=0x4AAAAAAB56ltjhELoBWYew
TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=0x4AAAAAAB56ljRNTob9cGtXsqh8c-ZuxxE
```

Then update the code to use `env('TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY')` and `env('TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY')`.
